# i6.shark

An IPv6 proxy server that allows you to make HTTP requests from randomly generated IPv6 addresses in a /48 subnet. This project basically built the best proxy on earth, a /48 subnet has `1,208,925,819,614,629,174,706,176` (1.2 × 10²⁴) IPv6 addresses, which if you can't tell is a lot. Using a single subnet means those who really want to block you can block your ASN address, so be careful with that. This project is designed to be used for educational purposes only, and should not be used for any illegal activities (totally).
